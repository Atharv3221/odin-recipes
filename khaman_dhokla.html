        <pr class="text"><strong>Steps:</strong></pr>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the gram flour (besan), semolina (sooji), yogurt (dahi), and water. Mix well until you get a smooth<br>
                batter without any lumps.</li>
            <li>Add vegetable oil, sugar, green chili paste, ginger paste, turmeric powder, and salt to the batter. Mix thoroughly to incorporate<br>
                all the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Let the batter rest for about 10-15 minutes. This resting period allows the flavors to meld, and the batter will become slightly thicker.</li>
            <li>In a separate small bowl, dissolve the Eno fruit salt (or baking soda) in 1-2 tablespoons of water. Stir it into the batter immediately.<br>
                You will notice that the batter will become frothy and increase in volume. Mix gently, but do not overmix.</li>
            <li>Grease a plate or a dhokla steamer tray with some oil to prevent sticking. Make sure it fits comfortably in your steamer.</li>
            <li>Pour the prepared batter into the greased plate or tray, filling it about 2/3 full. Tap the plate on the counter to remove air bubbles.</li>
            <li>Heat water in your steamer or a large pot with a steaming rack. Place the plate or tray with the batter inside the steamer.</li>
            <li>Steam the batter for approximately 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the dhokla comes out clean. Be sure to keep the steamer<br>
                covered while steaming.</li>
            <li>Once done, remove the plate or tray from the steamer and allow it to cool for a few minutes. This will make it easier to cut into pieces.</li>
            <li>In a small pan, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds and let them splutter.</li>
            <li>Add green chilies, asafoetida (hing), and curry leaves. Saut√© for a minute until the chilies become slightly tender.</li>
            <li>Add 2 tablespoons of water, sugar, and lemon juice to the tempering mixture. Stir well until the sugar dissolves and the mixture thickens slightly.</li>
            <li>Pour the prepared tempering mixture evenly over the steamed Khaman Dhokla.</li>
            <li>Garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves and grated coconut if desired.</li>
            <li>Allow the Khaman Dhokla to cool for a few more minutes before slicing it into squares or diamond shapes.</li>
            <li>Serve the Khaman Dhokla with green chutney or tamarind chutney for a delightful snack or appetizer.</li>
