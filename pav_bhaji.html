        <pr>Pav Bhaji is a flavorsome and hearty meal that has a delicious blend of spicy <br>
            mixed vegetables, served alongside soft butter toasted dinner rolls, crunchy onions <br>
            and lemon wedges. This homemade Mumbai street style snack meal tastes absolutely <br>
            phenomenal and is a total crowd-pleaser with bold flavors.</pr>
        <pr><strong>Steps:</strong></pr>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the veggies first and keep them ready.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of butter and oil in a large pot on medium heat.<br>
                 Once the butter melts and oil is hot, add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped onions and mix. I like to use my food processor to chop them really fine.</li>
            <li>Cook the onions for around 4 minutes until golden brown in color.<br>
                 Add the finely chopped ginger, garlic and green chili. Again,<br>
                  I used my food processor to chop them really fine.<br>
                Cook the ginger-garlic-green chili for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add chopped tomatoes and mix well. Let the tomatoes cook for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add tomato puree, 1/4 cup water and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cover the pan and<br>
                 let the tomato cook for 6 minutes until softened and completely cooked.</li>
            <li>Add the pav bhaji masala, Kashmiri red chili powder, red chili powder and<br>
                 remaining 1 teaspoon of salt. You may also add 1/2 teaspoon of sugar here (optional).</li>
            <li> Mix well and then add in 2 teaspoons of kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves)</li>
            <li>Stir in the boiled veggies and mix.</li>
            <li>Using a potato masher, mash the veggies until they are completely mixed with the masala.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining 3/4 - 1 cup water and mix. I used an immersion blender to blend<br>
                the veggies to a paste like consistency, this is optional. You may keep them as such.<br>
                Cover the pot and set heat to low. Let the bhaji simmer on low heat for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Open the pot and add in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.</li>
            <li>Add a generous amount of chopped cilantro.</li>
            <li>Then add in juice of 1 large lemon. Let the bhaji simmer for 2 more minutes and then remove<br>
                 pan from heat.</li>
            <li>To toast the pav, melt butter on a pan. Sprinkle some pav bhaji masala on top of the butter and<br>
                 then place the buns on the pan.</li>
            <li>Press to toast the pav until crisp and golden brown from both sides.</li>
        </ol>
