        <P class="text"><strong>Dosa</strong> is a popular south Indian breakfast where a crispy crepe made of fermented rice and lentil batter is served<br>
            with flavorful spiced potato curry. It is a wholesome meal in itself as it is served with potato masala, <strong>Coconut chutney</strong> and <strong>Sambar</strong>.<br>
            It is believed Masala dosa originated in Tuluva Mangalorean cusine, from Karnataka(source: Wiki). Udupi restaurants made this toothsome and delectable<br>
            food very popular all over India and now these are popular in many countries.</p>
        <p>But making a good special restaurants style masala dosa at home needs experimenting a lot. A special restaurant style masala dosa is much more flavourful<br>
        than the regular crispy dosa we make at home. So the proportions of rice, dal, methi, chana dal and poha change here.</p>
        <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>First, wash and soak dosa rice in vessel for 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Same way was urad dal + fenugreek seeds together in another vessel.</li>
            <li>After 3 hours, to begin with, drain water from urad dal + fenugreek seeds. Place in the blender.</li>
            <li>Grind with ice water adding little by little and equally important, in regular intervals to prevent<br>
                 over heating and not all together. In other words, if you grind it right, it will have small bubbles seen in batter.</li>
            <li>Then, transfer to a large vessel enough to hold both batter.</li>
            <li>After that, place the rice, salt and cooked rice (if adding) in a mixie (blender).</li>
            <li>Likewise, using ice water, grind to a smooth batter. Do give time in between if it is hot and also add water carefully<br>
                without making it watery.</li>
            <li>Then, transfer it along with ground urad dal batter.</li>
            <li>After that, mix thoroughly and keep aside for fermentation.</li>
            <li>Eventually, it will take from 12 to15 hours for fermentation.</li>
            <li>To make dosa, firstly take required portion of batter in a mixing bowl. Then add very little water, say Â¼ cup per 2 cups of batter.</li>
            <li>Mix really well to make dosa. It spreads easily and evenly in dosa pan when we add water to batter and mix well.</li>
        </ol>
