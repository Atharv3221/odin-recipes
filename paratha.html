        <p>This dish provides carbohydrates, protein, fiber, and potassium. The nutrition profile can be enhanced by making the right <br>
          choice of filling. Traditionally parathas have always been paired with a glass of buttermilk or a bowl of curd which makes <br>
          it a balanced meal.</p>
        <pr><strong>Steps:</strong></pr>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl add 2 cups of whole wheat flour, 1 teaspoon of oil or ghee, 1/2 teaspoon of salt.<br>
                Add 1/2 cup water in portions as you go on mixing and kneading the dough. Keep in mind not to add all of the water at once.</li>
            <li>Mix and knead into a smooth, soft dough. Continue to add a bit more water a splash at a time if required<br> 
                while kneading. Cover with a kitchen towel and set the dough aside to rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pinch a medium-sized ball from the dough. Dust with flour and flatten on a clean surface that's also dusted with a bit of flour.</li>
            <li>Use a rolling pin to roll the paratha dough into a circle that's about 4 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li>Next, use the back of a spoon to spread some ghee (or oil) to coat the surface of the dough circle.</li>
            <li>Fold the dough circle in half with the spoon.</li>
            <li>Now spread some more ghee on this folded half of dough.</li>
            <li>Fold sideways to create a triangle shape.</li>
            <li>Dust some flour on the folded triangle.</li>
            <li>Roll the folded triangle back into a round disc of dough or in a triangular shape.</li>
            <li>As you roll you can add some flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking. The dough should be rolled into<br>
                a circle that's about 6 to 7 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li>To make a square version of paratha, first flatten a medium-sized ball of dough on a lightly dusted board. Roll<br>
                 out to form a circle of about 4 to 5 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li>Use a spoon to evenly spread some ghee or oil on the rolled dough.</li>
            <li>Bring one side of the rolled dough towards the center and press lightly. Spread more ghee on the folded part.</li>
            <li>Fold the opposite side of the rolled dough on top of the folded part. Press lightly, and again spread the ghee on this<br>
                 second folded part.</li>
            <li>Next, fold the right side of the paratha dough to bring it towards the center. Spread some ghee on this fold, too.</li>
            <li>Lastly, fold the left side on top of the right fold. You should have a nice little bundle of dough.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle some flour on the folded paratha.</li>
            <li>Begin to roll. Add some more flour if needed while rolling so that the dough doesn't stick.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough into a square shape.</li>
            <li> Once you've rolled out all of the paratha dough discs or square, heat a tawa (skillet) over medium heat on the<br>
                stovetop. Working one at a time, place one of the paratha onto the tawa.<br>
                To test the hotness of the skillet, sprinkle a few pinches of flour in the center. if it browns in a few seconds,<br> 
                the tawa is hot enough to begin with the paratha roasting.<br>
                With a kitchen napkin, wipe off these browned flour particles from the skillet before you begin roasting paratha.</li>
            <li>The paratha will begin to puff up and bubble from the heat. Roast paratha on a medium to high heat and do regulate<br> 
                the heat as needed. A thin skillet or pan will need medium heat and a heavy skillet or pan will need medium-high to high heat.</li>
            <li>When the bottom of the paratha is about ¼ of the way browned (you will see the paratha having some air pockets), flip<br> 
                it over with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Spread on some ghee.</li>
            <li>Flip again when the second side is about ½ way cooked. You will see brown spots now.</li>
            <li>Flip again a couple of times until you see more brown spots and the paratha is cooked evenly.<br>
                Transfer to a holding plate or a casserole container or a roti basket/box, and repeat the process to cook all of the flatbreads.</li>
            <li> Serve the plain paratha right away while hot or store in a roti basket until ready to enjoy.<br>
                Paratha can be served with any Indian mains like lentils, curries, gravies and even dry sautéed or steamed vegetable dishes.<br>
                 You can also enjoy them with mango pickle or lemon pickle.</li>
